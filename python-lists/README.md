## List 

Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

Lists are created using square brackets:

```

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist)

```

## List Items

List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.

List items are indexed, the first item has index **[0]**, the second item has index **[1]** etc.


## Ordered

When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.

**Note: There are some list methods that will change the order, but in general: the order of the items will not change**
