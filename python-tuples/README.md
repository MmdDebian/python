## Tuple

Tuple are used to store items in a single variables 


Tuple in one of 4 built-in data types in python used to store collections of data , the other 3 are **list** , **Set** , and **Dictionary** , all with differrent qualities nad usage .

A tuple is a collection which is ordered and **unchangeable**.

Tuples are written with round brackets.

```
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(thistuple)

```

## Tuple Items

Tuple items are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values.

Tuple items are indexed, the first item has index **[0]**, the second item has index **[1]** etc.


## Ordered

When we say that tuples are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.


## Unchangeable

Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change, add or remove items after the tuple has been created.


## Allow Duplicates

Since tuples are indexed, they can have items with the same value:

```
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry")
print(thistuple)

```
