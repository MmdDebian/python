## Execute Python Syntax

As we learned in the previous page, Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line:

```
>>> print("Hello, World!")
Hello, World!

```


## Python Indentation

Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
<br>
Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

```
if 5 > 2:
  print("Five is greater than two!")
  
```
