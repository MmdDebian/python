## Python Striang 

## String 

string in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks , or double quotation marks .

```
'hello' is the same as "hello"

```

You can display a string literal with the **print()**  function :

```
print("Hello")
print('Hello')

```


## Assign string to a Variable 

Assigning a string to a variable is done with the variable name followed by an equal sign and the string:

```
a = "Hello"
print(a)

```

## Multiline Strings

You can assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes:

```
loremText = """Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."""
print(a)

```
Or three single quotes:

```
loremText = '''Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.'''
print(a)

```

**Note**: in the result, the line breaks are inserted at the same position as in the code.


## Strings are Arrays

Like many other popular programming languages, strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters.

However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1.

Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.

```
a = "Hello, World!"
print(a[1])

```


## Looping Through a String

Since strings are arrays, we can loop through the characters in a string, with a for loop.

```
for x in "banana":
  print(x)

```

## String Length

To get the length of a string, use the **len()** function.

```
a = "Hello, World!"
print(len(a))

```


## Check String

Check if "free" is present in the following text :â€Œ

```
txt = "The best things in life are free!"
print("free" in txt)

```

Use it in an **if** statement:

```
txt = "The best things in life are free!"
if "free" in txt:
  print("Yes, 'free' is present.")

```

## Check if NOT

To check if a certain phrase or character is NOT present in a string, we can use the keyword **not** **in**


```

txt = "The best things in life are free!"
print("expensive" not in txt)

```

Use it in an **if** statement:

```
txt = "The best things in life are free!"
if "expensive" not in txt:
  print("No, 'expensive' is NOT present.")

```
