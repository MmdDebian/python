## Python numbers 

There are three numeric types in Python:

-int
-float
-complex

Variables of numeric types are created when you assign a value to them:

```

x = 1    # int
y = 2.8  # float
z = 1j   # complex

```


## Int

Int, or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.

```
x = 1
y = 35656222554887711
z = -3255522

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))

```

## Float

Float, or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.


```
x = 1.10
y = 1.0
z = -35.59

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))

```

Float can also be scientific numbers with an "e" to indicate the power of 10.

```

x = 35e3
y = 12E4
z = -87.7e100

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))

```
