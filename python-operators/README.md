## Python Operators

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:

```
print(10 + 5)

```

Python divides the operators in the following groups:

* Arithmetic operators
* Assignment operators
* Comparison operators
* Logical operators
* Identity operators
* Membership operators
* Bitwise operators

| Operator| Name| Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| + | Addition | x + y |
| - | Subtraction | x - y |
| * | Multiplication | x * y |
| / | division | x / y |
| % | Modulus | x % y |
| ** | Exponentiation | x ** y |
| // | Floor division | x // y |


## Python Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:

| Operator| Example| Same As |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | 
| = | x = 5 | x = 5 |
| += | x += 3 | x = x + 3| 
| -= | x -= 3 | x = x - 3 | 
| *= | x *= 3 | x = x * 3 | 
| /= | x /= 3 | x = x / 3 |
| %= | x %= 3 | x = x % 3 |
| //= | x //= 3 | x = x // 3 | 
| **= | x **= 3 | x = x ** 3 | 
| &= | x &= 3 | x = x & 3 | 
| ^= | x ^= 3 | x = x ^ 3 | 
| >>= | x >>= 3 | x = x >> 3 | 
| <<= | x <<= 3 | x = x << 3 |
