## Python Operators

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:

```
print(10 + 5)

```

Python divides the operators in the following groups:

* Arithmetic operators
* Assignment operators
* Comparison operators
* Logical operators
* Identity operators
* Membership operators
* Bitwise operators
