## Python Operators

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:

```
print(10 + 5)

```

Python divides the operators in the following groups:

* Arithmetic operators
* Assignment operators
* Comparison operators
* Logical operators
* Identity operators
* Membership operators
* Bitwise operators

| Operator| Name| Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| + | Addition | x + y |
| - | Subtraction | x - y |
| * | Multiplication | x * y |
| / | division | x / y |
| % | Modulus | x % y |
| ** | Exponentiation | x ** y |
| // | Floor division | x // y |
